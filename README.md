# Tourmaline
Tourmaline is a keyboard loosely based on the Dactyl (https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard). 

I want to adjust many small details of the dactyl and I strongly prefer openjscad as my 3d development language due to not requiring any installation (I just use the web renderer).

Currently this project is just reimplementing the dactyl in openjscad as I get familiar with it. Ultimately I would like to provide an easier customization process through the parameters defined in the openjscad web renderer. Specifically swappable switch type, keycap sizing for specific elements (specifically the outer most pinky column being 1.25x size, so Kinesis keycaps would fit by default), UI definable finger z & y offsets, and the ability to print halves with full 90 degree tenting to eliminate twisting of the wrist.
